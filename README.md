# Survival Analysis In Sports

Pulled the data using `BeautifulSoup` of all cricket players, and created the model for predicting probability of career length of a given player
(i.e. player with more than 8k runs have 90% probability of 12yrs career length)

## some Application of survival analysis

There are four major applications of survival analysis into `analytics`:
- Business Planning : Profiling customers who has a higher survival rate and make strategy accordingly.
- Lifetime Value Prediction : Engage with customers according to their lifetime value

# Cricket Survival Analysis

Here we are plotting 3 graphs (https://goo.gl/photos/y8Fq4eR2VqDPiGSL7) 
First we will pulled our data and fetch them in the correct data format for modeling graphs
For this data we have created 3 graphs but similarly you can create many different statistically related graphs. 

- ![Country(players) vs career length](https://github.com/rushil83/Cricket_Survival_Analysis/blob/master/graphs/countrys_vs_career-length.png) : this graph tells us about what are the probability of that countrys players
to survive the specific career length

- ![runs vs career length](https://github.com/rushil83/Cricket_Survival_Analysis/blob/master/graphs/runs_vs_career-length.png)
